# Favorite In Class Puzzle: Three Prisoners Problem
 This riddle is about what seems like a paradoxical probability. You are one out of three prisoners and a random two of you will be executed tomorrow. You ask the guard about what will happen and he tells you that another prisoner will be one of the guys who die tomorrow. He cannot tell you anything about your fate. You may think that this makes your probability of living go up, but it actually decreases it.

# Favorite Out of Class Puzzle: Rubik's Cube
 This is a very popular toy that is a cube consisting of 6 different faces with 9 spots in each face. The point of the cube is to get all the spots in each face of the same color.
